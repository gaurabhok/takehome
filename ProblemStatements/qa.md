**Title: Automated Testing for an E-commerce Website**

Description:
In this take-home assignment, your goal is to design and implement an automated testing strategy to ensure the quality and functionality of the website. This assignment will help us assess your skills in test planning, test case design, and test automation.

Instructions:

**Part 1: Test Planning**

1. **Test Strategy Document**: Create a test strategy document that outlines your approach to testing the e-commerce website. Include the following:

   - Objectives of testing
   - Scope of testing
   - Testing levels (e.g., unit, integration, system, acceptance)
   - Testing types (e.g., functional, usability, performance)
   - Entry and exit criteria
   - Test environment and tools
   - Risk analysis

2. **Test Plan**: Develop a detailed test plan that covers the following areas:
   - Test deliverables
   - Test schedule
   - Test resources
   - Test data and environment setup
   - Test execution and reporting

**Part 2: Test Case Design** 3. **Functional Test Cases**: Create a set of functional test cases for the key features of the e-commerce website. The features to consider may include user registration, product search, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and order management.

4. **Edge and Boundary Test Cases**: Develop edge and boundary test cases to test the robustness of the system. For example, test scenarios where users input data at the extreme ends of acceptable values.

**Part 3: Test Automation** 5. **Test Automation Framework**: Choose a test automation framework (e.g., Selenium, Appium, or any other of your choice) and explain why you selected it. Provide a brief overview of the framework's architecture.

6. **Automated Test Scripts**: Implement automated test scripts for at least three critical test scenarios from the functional test cases you designed in Part 2. Ensure that your automated tests cover both positive and negative test cases.

7. **Test Data Management**: Include methods for managing test data within your automation scripts. This could involve using test data files, databases, or data generation within the scripts.

**Submission Requirements:**

- Your submission should be well-documented and organized.
- Provide clear instructions for setting up the test environment and running the automated tests.
- Include any necessary configuration files or dependencies.
- Submit your solution in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub) and provide a link for review.
- Include a README with instructions for running the tests and any additional comments you think are relevant.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the clarity and completeness of your test planning, the effectiveness of your test cases, and the quality of your automated test scripts.

P.S. Any assumptions taken while design / implementation should be documented in README file
